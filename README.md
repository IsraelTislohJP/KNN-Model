**Wine Quality Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in R**

This project involves building a classification model to predict wine quality using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in R.

**Project Overview**

In this project, I utilized the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify wine quality based on various features from the wine dataset. The key steps involved include:

Data Importation: The dataset was imported, and necessary packages were loaded.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset was manipulated to prepare it for model building. This included handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Model Building: The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was used to build the classification model.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated on the test set, yielding results that can be compared with other classification techniques.

**Requirements**

R (version 4.0 or above)

class package (for KNN)
